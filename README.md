# Text-Editor
The Text Editor Graphical User Interface project is a desktop-based application developed using Java, Swing, and Intellij IDEA.
The goal of this project was to create a text editor with a graphical user interface that replicates some of the features found in MS Word. 
Users can format their text by applying styles such as bold, italic, and underline, as well as choose different text colors.
